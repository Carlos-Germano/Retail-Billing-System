# Retail-Billing-System
Recently, I decided to delve deeper into the various possibilities that the Python language offers. In particular, I started exploring the Tkinter library, widely recognized for creating intuitive graphical interfaces. Motivated by a YouTube tutorial, I put into practice what I learned and created a Retail Billing System using Tkinte.
